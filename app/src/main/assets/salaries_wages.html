<h2>Salaries and Wages</h2>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This module covers essential concepts and computations related to salaries, wages, income,
        and benefits for both employees and employers.</p>
    <p>You will gain an understanding of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculating gross pay and net pay</li>
        <li>Determining deductions from wages</li>
        <li>Understanding overtime pay calculations</li>
        <li>Calculating commissions and bonuses</li>
        <li>Evaluating fringe benefits</li>
        <li>Comparing different payment methods</li>
        <li>Analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each payment method</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Calculating Gross Pay and Net Pay</h3>
    <p>Gross pay refers to the total amount of money an employee earns before any deductions are
        taken out. This includes regular wages as well as any additional earnings such as overtime
        pay, commissions, or bonuses.</p>
    <p>Net pay, on the other hand, is the amount of money an employee takes home after deductions
        such as taxes, insurance premiums, and retirement contributions are subtracted from gross
        pay.</p>
    <p>Understanding how to calculate gross pay and net pay is essential for both employees and
        employers to ensure accurate compensation.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Determining Deductions from Wages</h3>
    <p>Deductions from wages include various expenses that are withheld from an employee's paycheck.
        These deductions may include federal and state income taxes, Social Security and Medicare
        taxes, health insurance premiums, retirement contributions, and other voluntary
        deductions.</p>
    <p>Employers must accurately calculate and withhold these deductions in compliance with federal
        and state regulations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Understanding Overtime Pay Calculations</h3>
    <p>Overtime pay is additional compensation provided to employees for hours worked beyond the
        standard workweek or workday. In most cases, employees are entitled to overtime pay at a
        rate of one and a half times their regular hourly rate for each hour worked beyond 40 hours
        in a workweek.</p>
    <p>Employers must accurately track employees' hours and calculate overtime pay to ensure
        compliance with labor laws.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Calculating Commissions and Bonuses</h3>
    <p>Commissions and bonuses are forms of incentive compensation provided to employees based on
        their performance or the achievement of specific goals. Commissions are typically a
        percentage of sales revenue, while bonuses may be fixed amounts or tied to performance
        metrics.</p>
    <p>Employers must establish clear criteria for earning commissions and bonuses and accurately
        calculate and distribute these payments to eligible employees.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Evaluating Fringe Benefits</h3>
    <p>Fringe benefits are non-wage compensations provided to employees in addition to their regular
        wages or salaries. These benefits may include health insurance, retirement plans, paid time
        off, and other perks such as tuition reimbursement or company-sponsored events.</p>
    <p>Employers offer fringe benefits as a way to attract and retain talent and enhance employee
        satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Comparing Payment Methods</h3>
    <p>There are various payment methods employers may use to compensate employees, including hourly
        wages, salaries, piece rates, commissions, and bonuses. Each payment method has its
        advantages and disadvantages in terms of simplicity, flexibility, and cost.</p>
    <p>Employers must carefully consider the needs of their workforce and business objectives when
        selecting the most appropriate payment method.</p>

    <div class="design">
        <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
        <p>Each payment method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hourly Wages:</strong> Provide flexibility for fluctuating work hours but
                may
                result in unpredictable income for employees.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Salaries:</strong> Offer stability and predictability for employees but may
                not
                accurately compensate for overtime or extra hours worked.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Piece Rates:</strong> Incentivize productivity but may lead to quality or
                safety
                concerns if workers prioritize quantity over quality.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Commissions and Bonuses:</strong> Motivate sales performance but may create
                competition and resentment among employees.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Employers must weigh these factors carefully to choose the payment method that best
            aligns
            with their business goals and values.</p>
